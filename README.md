A few things about Chatgpt:
(see (here)[https://kastlunger.blogspot.com/2025/03/chatgpt-2-or-how-to-develop-simple.html] for more details)
- at the time of writing, it doesn't do any Pull Requests (nor downloads) from a free account

- it made a simple QML mistake in the code; defining a method `open` in the `Dialog` item, which overrides it's own `open` function.
