An app to select a food based on specific requirements
Generated (partly) with Chatgpt.

A few things about Chatgpt:

- at the time of writing, it doesn't do any Pull Requests (nor downloads) from a free account

- it made a simple QML mistake in the code; defining a method `open` in the `Dialog` item, which overrides it's own `open` function.
